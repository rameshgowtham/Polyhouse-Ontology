## An Interoperable Ontology for CPS-Enabled Polyhouses Solar Dryer : A Case Study of the AgroESP Project 

The dataset includes Polyhouse 3D Design, Object files of polyhouse components, and Polyhouse Ontology
- _Polyhouse 3D design.skp_ - This file is a 3D model created for the polyhouse. The file consists of representations of various independent entities present in the polyhouse. These entities are created by manually grouping logical components which includes various structural components, building elements, CPS components, and material details of the polyhouse.

- _Polyhouse.ifc_ - The file contains a 3D model of the polyhouse exported in the open Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. IFC is a global standard designed for sharing and exchanging information across the construction and management sectors.

- _The Polyhouse Design OBJ files_ - This folder contains the geometry of polyhouse components in the Wavefront OBJ format. The URIs of each of these OBJ files in this Git repository are used to create individuals in the polyhouse ontology, representing 3D models of specific components annotated in the ontology. The individuals and corresponding OBJ files are linked using the has3DModel object property.

- _Polyhouse.ttl_ - Is a unified polyhouse ontology designed to model complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). This ontology primarily reuses concepts defined in popular domain ontologies to represent polyhouse operations.
