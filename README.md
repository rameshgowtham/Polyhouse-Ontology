## An Interoperable Ontology for CPS-Enabled Polyhouses Solar Dryer : A Case Study of the AgroESP Project 

The dataset includes Polyhouse 3D Design, Object files of polyhouse components, and Polyhouse Ontology
- **_Polyhouse 3D design.skp_ - This file is a 3D model created for the polyhouse. The file consists of representations of various independent entities present in the polyhouse. These entities are created by manually grouping logical components which includes various structural components, building elements, CPS components, and material details of the polyhouse.

- **_Polyhouse.ifc_ - The file contains a 3D model of the polyhouse exported in the open Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. IFC is a global standard designed for sharing and exchanging information across the construction and management sectors.
