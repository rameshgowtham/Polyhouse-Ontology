## An Interoperable Ontology for CPS-Enabled Polyhouses Solar Dryer : A Case Study of the AgroESP Project 

The 3D model created for the polyhouse considers the entire structure as a single entity. However, the polyhouse comprises various distinct objects, each made of different materials. This necessitates manual grouping of these entities for subsequent processing and querying. Such logical grouping allows us to differentiate between the entities within the polyhouse, enabling us to uniquely identify and extract essential information from each entity.

The 3D model of the polyhouse is exported into the open Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format. IFC is a global standard designed for sharing and exchanging information across construction and management sectors
